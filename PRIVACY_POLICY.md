# Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 26, 2024

## Introduction

ChatForge ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and handle your data when you use our mobile application (ChatForge).

## Information Collection and Use

### Local Storage
ChatForge is designed with privacy in mind. All of your data, including:
- Conversations
- Messages
- API keys
- Application settings
- Provider configurations

is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to us or any of our servers.

### Data Transmission to Third Parties
When you use ChatForge to interact with AI models, your messages are sent directly to the respective AI provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) according to your configuration. Please note:

- We do not process, intercept, or store any of this data
- The handling of your data by these third-party providers is governed by their respective privacy policies:
  - OpenAI: https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy
  - Anthropic: https://www.anthropic.com/privacy
  - Google: https://policies.google.com/privacy

We strongly encourage you to review these privacy policies to understand how your data is handled by these providers.

### Advertising
The free version of ChatForge includes advertising provided by Google AdMob. AdMob may collect and process data as described in their privacy policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

The paid version of ChatForge does not include any advertising.

## Data Security
We take reasonable measures to help protect your local data:
- All data is stored in local databases on your device
- API keys are stored securely using platform-specific security features where available
- No data is transmitted without your explicit action (sending a message to an AI provider)

## Children's Privacy
Our app is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Changes are effective immediately upon posting to this repository.
