### Styleguides

#### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * üö± `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
    * üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
    * üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * üî• `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * üíö `:green_heart:` when fixing CI
    * ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
    * üîí `:lock:` when dealing with security
    * ‚¨ÜÔ∏è `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
    * ‚¨áÔ∏è `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies

#### Dart Style Guide

Follow the [official Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style) and these additional rules:

* Use `final` or `const` whenever possible
* Sort imports alphabetically
* Group imports by type (dart, package, relative)
* Use explicit types for public APIs
* Document all public APIs with dartdoc comments
* Keep lines under 80 characters
* Use trailing commas for better formatting

```dart
// Good
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:io';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';

import '../models/user.dart';
import '../services/auth_service.dart';

/// A widget that displays user information.
class UserInfoWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final User user;
  final VoidCallback onLogout;

  const UserInfoWidget({
    required this.user,
    required this.onLogout,
    Key? key,
  }) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          Text(user.name),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: onLogout,
            child: const Text('Logout'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

#### Documentation Styleguide

* Use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
* Document all public APIs.
* Include code examples for complex functionality.
* Keep documentation up to date with code changes.
* Reference the version number when documenting features.

### Testing Guidelines

* Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
* Maintain or improve test coverage with each PR
* Follow the testing pyramid:
    * Unit tests for business logic
    * Widget tests for UI components
    * Integration tests for critical user flows

#### Example Test Structure

```dart
void main() {
  group('UserRepository', () {
    late UserRepository repository;
    late MockAuthService authService;

    setUp(() {
      authService = MockAuthService();
      repository = UserRepository(authService);
    });

    test('getCurrentUser returns user when authenticated', () async {
      // Arrange
      final expectedUser = User(id: '1', name: 'Test User');
      when(authService.currentUser).thenReturn(expectedUser);

      // Act
      final result = await repository.getCurrentUser();

      // Assert
      expect(result, expectedUser);
    });
  });
}
```

### Branch Naming Convention

* Feature branches: `feature/description`
* Bug fix branches: `fix/description`
* Documentation branches: `docs/description`
* Performance improvement branches: `perf/description`

Example: `feature/add-gemini-support`
